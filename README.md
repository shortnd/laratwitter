# LaraTwitter

This is a Simple Laravel and Vue Web App. Its a simple clone of twitter that I will be slowly working on

## Installation

* Clone Repository
* move into directory
* Run these two commands in the directory
```bash
composer install
```
```bash
# npm install
yarn
```
* Then setup your database
* Run artisan migrate
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

## Thanks
This is still a work in progress and really just here to help me get better understanding of both Vue and Laravel before I make a bigger application
